# spinner_design_project

## Overview
This project involves the design, analysis, and manufacturing of fidget spinners within specified constraints. The goal is to create visually appealing fidget spinners using various processes, including computer-aided design (CAD), finite-element analysis (FEA), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), laser cutting, additive manufacturing (AM), and injection molding. The project emphasizes creativity, adherence to design specifications, and iterative testing.

## Project Phases

### 1. Design
- **CAD Design:** Create detailed designs for the fidget spinners, considering both aesthetic appeal and functionality.
- **Assembly Files:** Develop assembly files to visualize and finalize the design.

### 2. Analysis
- **Finite-Element Analysis (FEA):** Conduct preliminary FEA to assess the structural integrity and performance of the fidget spinner design.

### 3. Manufacturing
- **CAM Programs:** Develop CAM programs to create molds for manufacturing the fidget spinners.
- **CNC Milling:** Manufacture molds using computer numeric control (CNC) mills.
- **Injection Molding:** Use the molds to produce the body of the fidget spinner through the injection molding process.
- **Laser Cutting and Additive Manufacturing (AM):** Employ laser cutting and AM processes for creative design elements.

### 4. Testing and Iterations
- **Design Iterations:** Conduct testing and iterate on the design to meet specifications and constraints (GD&T).

## Provided Files
- **Spinner Part & Assembly CAD File:** Files containing the CAD design for the fidget spinner.
- **Spinner Mold CAD Files:** Files containing the CAD design for the mold used in manufacturing.
- **Spinner Mold CAM Files:** CAM files used in the CNC milling process for manufacturing the spinner mold.
- **Spinner STL File:** STL file for the fidget spinner, provided for reference and further modifications.

## Usage
1. Use the provided CAD files for the spinner assembly and mold as references for visualizing the design.
2. Utilize the CAM files for CNC milling to manufacture the spinner mold.
3. Follow the manufacturing process, including injection molding, laser cutting, and AM, to fabricate the fidget spinner.
4. Conduct testing and iterate on the design as necessary to meet specifications.
